# Handheld Remote SOP 

## Operation of WAM-V

### Surge and Yaw

- The left joystick controls the surge motion of the WAM-V. Move the left joystick upwards to surge forward, downwards to surge in the reverse direction.
- The right joystick controls the yaw motion of the WAM-V. Move the right joystick to the right to rotate the WAM-V clockwise, left to rotate the WAM-V counter clockwise.

### Kill Switch

- The kill switch is labelled on the handheld controller. If you were to look at the switch from a top-down perspective, moving it downwards will "unkill" the WAM-V, upwards to kill the WAM-V.    

### Operation Mode

- The WAM-V has two operation modes: manual and autonomous. Move switch A upwards to have the WAM-V operate in "autonomous" mode, downwards to have the WAM-V operate in "manual" mode. 

## Handheld Controller Calibration Process

1. Ensure system is in it's kill state. Calibration will not occur in other states. 
2. Put joystick in one of its extreme positions (e.g. surge joystick in it's full up position). 
3. Flip the calibration switch to the UP position and wait a couple seconds while holding the joystick in its extreme position.
4. While still holding the joystick in its extreme position, flip the calibration switch back down. 
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for the other joystick(s) extreme positions. 

## Handheld Controller Software Reset Process

- Flip switch D into the upwards position and keep it there for 4 seconds. 
- The visual indicator (i.e. LED strip on the wireless pole) will turn off momentarily and turn back on indicating the MainMega in the low current box has reset.  
- Flip switch D back into the downwards position to prevent the MainMega to reset again.
