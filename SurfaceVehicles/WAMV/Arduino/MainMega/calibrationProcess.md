2. Put joystick in one of its extreme positions (e.g. surge joystick in it's full up position). 
3. Flip the calibration switch to the UP position and wait a couple seconds while holding the joystick in its extreme position.
4. While still holding the joystick in its extreme position, flip the calibration switch back down. 
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for the other joystick(s) extreme positions.
