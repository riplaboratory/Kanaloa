## ESP32 and Arduino Code Documentation

This directory contains information on ESP32 set-up, basic ROS commands, problems/solutions the WSN team experiencesd, the Arduino libraries needed for the WSN system, and the final scripts implemented for the GPS and IMU as of May 2021.

 ### Some technical clarification:
 The WSN team used a microcontroller chip called an ESP32. There are many types of ESP32 chips, but we chose the ESP32-WROOM-32 chip ([datasheet](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-wroom-32_datasheet_en.pdf)), as it was readily available on an easy to use and affordable development board. The development board, pictured above, is the [DOIT ESP32 DevKit V1](https://www.banggood.com/ESP32-Development-Board-WiFi+bluetooth-Ultra-Low-Power-Consumption-Dual-Cores-ESP-32-ESP-32S-Board-p-1109512.html?cur_warehouse=USA&rmmds=buy) board.
