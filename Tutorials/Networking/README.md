This is a technical documentation to explain concepts about networking. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA9bsGBx5vs) is a video of Bill Porter, the main network guy in RobotX, explaining networking basics in an easy to understand fashion. **I highly recommend watching this video before reading any of my documentation.** If you understand everything Bill says in this video, you'll know enough about networking to understand Kanaloa's current network configuration.
