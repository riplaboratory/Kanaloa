This is a technical documentation to explain concepts about networking. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA9bsGBx5vs) is a video of Bill Porter, the main network guy in RobotX, explaining networking basics in an easy to understand fashion. I highly recommend watching this video before reading any of my documentation. If you understand everything Bill says in this video, you'll know enough about networking to understand Kanaloa's current network configuration.
